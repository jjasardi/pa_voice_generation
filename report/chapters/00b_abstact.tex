\section*{Abstract}

Voice generation through \gls{dnn} has experienced the same advancements as many other products of artificial intelligence with the rise of public attention and investments. Through voice conversion it is possible to synthesize a human-sounding voice based on short inputs from a targeted speaker. With the increased quality of the end product the differences between real speech and synthesized speech are becoming evanescent.
We study multiple open-source implementations of \gls{dnn} and compare them with "our methods". % TODO: replace our methods

From a IT security perspective we come to "these results" % TODO: replace these results
